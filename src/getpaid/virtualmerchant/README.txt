GetPaid Virtual Merchant Payment Processor
=======================================

This payment processor is designed to work with the 'Virtual Merchant' payment
gateway from Elavon. It is an ''onsite'' payment processor, which means
all the processing is done on the Plone site with no redirections offsite.

This payment processor was developed by Tim Knapp of Emerge Technology and its
development was sponsored by netCorps and AMIGOS.
